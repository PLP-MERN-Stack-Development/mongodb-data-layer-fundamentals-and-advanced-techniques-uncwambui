🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates MongoDB fundamentals by building a simple bookstore database.
You will learn how to:

Install and set up MongoDB Community Edition

Create databases and collections

Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Write advanced queries with filters, projections, sorting, and pagination

Use aggregation pipelines for analytics

Implement indexes for performance optimization

🛠️ Setup Instructions
1. Install Prerequisites

MongoDB Community Edition

MongoDB Shell (mongosh)

Node.js (v18 or higher)

MongoDB Compass
 (optional GUI tool)

2. Verify Installation

Check versions:

mongod --version
mongosh --version
node -v
npm -v

3. Start MongoDB Server

Open a terminal and run:

mongod


This starts the MongoDB server at mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017.

4. Connect to MongoDB

📄 insert_books.js

This script connects to MongoDB and inserts 10+ sample book documents into the books collection.

Run it:

node insert_books.js


Check in mongosh:

use plp_bookstore
db.books.find()

📄 queries.js

This file contains:

CRUD operations

Advanced queries (filters, projections, sorting, pagination)

Aggregation pipelines

Indexing examples

Run it:

node queries.js


Expected console output:

A list of all books

Books by genre and year

Updates and deletions confirmed

Aggregated results (e.g., average prices, most common author)
